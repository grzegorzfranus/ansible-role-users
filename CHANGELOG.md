# Changelog

All notable changes to this User Management role will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-08

### Changed 🔄
- Respect configured `users_password_hash_algorithm` and remove deterministic salt usage in password hashing
- Use list type for `user.groups` instead of comma-joined string
- Simplify SSH directory group ownership default to rely on system defaults
- Remove non-idempotent `chage` command task (use `user.expires` instead)

### Added ✅
- New `users_overwrite_existing` default (false): when a user already exists, do not update password or other attributes unless `force` (per user) or `users_overwrite_existing` is true
- Password and attribute updates now conditionally apply only when creating a user or when overwrite is enabled
- Replace deprecated/legacy loops with modern style only where needed (kept structure consistent)
 - Password files are now written only when at least one password is generated (new users or overwrite)

### Fixed 🔧
- Molecule: Fix play name casing to start with uppercase (ansible-lint name[casing])
- Use `ansible.builtin.command` FQCN and add justified `# noqa command-instead-of-module` for systemd readiness check
- Replace unnecessary `shell` tasks in verify with modules/`command` invocations
- Address YAML long-line warnings by folding messages in `tasks/assert.yml`
- Remove `md5` from allowed hash algorithms in assertions and docs
- Clean `meta/main.yml` by removing non-standard `galaxy_tags` under platform entries

### Security 🔐
- Disallow weak `md5` hashing; only `sha512` and `sha256` accepted
- Narrow potential overuse of salts by letting `password_hash` generate a secure random salt

### Linting ✅
- ansible-lint: 0 failures on role and Molecule files
- yamllint: warnings addressed in assertions file
